## Networking concepts

---

Networking is the practice of connecting computers, servers, mobile devices, and other devices together in order to allow them to communicate and exchange information. This is done through a combination of hardware and software, including routers, switches, and protocols.

One key concept in networking is the use of IP addresses, which are numerical labels assigned to each device connected to a network. These addresses allow devices to communicate with one another and are divided into two main types: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers typically written as four numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1), while IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numbers written as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

Another important concept is the use of subnets, which are used to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable groups of devices. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including security, performance, and organization. When creating a subnet, you specify a subnet mask (a string of numbers such as 255.255.255.0), which determines the range of IP addresses that will be included in the subnet. For example, a subnet with the IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24 would include all IP addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.255.

In AWS, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a way of logically isolating parts of your infrastructure by creating a virtual network within the cloud. Within this VPC, you can create subnets, assign IP ranges, configure route tables, and more. This allows you to have complete control over your virtual networking environment and to build isolated networks.

A example of use cases for VPCs are:

Divide a network into public and private subnets, where the public subnet is used for web servers that need to be accessible to the internet, while the private subnet is used for database servers that should not be directly accessible from the internet.
Creating a VPN connection to link on-premises data centers with VPC to allow the secure and private communication between these networks.
Segregate different environments like staging, development and production.
In summary, networking is the practice of connecting devices together in order to allow them to communicate, with key concepts such as IP addresses and subnets that are used to organize and manage networks. And VPC in AWS provides a way of creating isolated and customizable virtual networks in the cloud.
