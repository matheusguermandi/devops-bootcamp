### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

IAM enables you to create and manage AWS users and groups and their corresponding access keys. With IAM, you can also grant and revoke permissions to allow and deny access to AWS services and resources. IAM supports identity federation and single sign-on (SSO) to allow users to sign in to the AWS Management Console or make programmatic calls to AWS services using existing corporate credentials.

IAM also helps you to secure your AWS account by creating and managing AWS IAM policies and roles. Policies are a set of permissions that define what actions a user or group can perform on AWS resources, and roles are a way to grant permissions to AWS resources to AWS services, applications or users.

IAM also enables you to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) for your AWS account and for users, to add an extra layer of security.

IAM also provides logging and auditing capabilities that help you to track and monitor access to your AWS resources and to comply with regulatory requirements.

In summary, AWS IAM is a powerful tool that allows you to manage access to your AWS resources, create and manage users and groups, grant and revoke permissions, secure your account and monitor your usage. With AWS IAM, you can ensure that only authorized users have access to your resources, and that access is controlled and logged for compliance and security purposes.

### Availability Zones (AZs).

Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions are geographically dispersed locations where AWS resources and services can be made available. Each region is a separate geographic area and consists of multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones (AZs).

Availability Zones (AZs) are physically separated locations within a region. Each AZ is made up of one or more data centers and is connected to the other zones in the same region through low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. By using multiple AZs, customers can build highly available and fault-tolerant applications, and protect their applications from the failure of a single location.

Each region is designed to be completely isolated from the other regions and provides a low-latency and high-throughput networking connection between resources inside the region. This allows customers to run their applications and store their data in the region that is closest to their customers for the best performance.

AWS offers a variety of services that can be used across multiple regions and availability zones, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), and more. This allows customers to spread their resources across multiple locations and ensure high availability and disaster recovery.

AWS customers can choose which region to launch resources in, and can also replicate resources across multiple regions for disaster recovery and compliance purposes. The choice of region depends on various factors such as proximity to end users, compliance and regulatory requirements and service availability.

In summary, AWS regions are geographically dispersed locations where AWS resources and services can be made available, each region is made up of multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones (AZs) which are physically separated locations within a region. By using multiple AZs and regions, customers can build highly available and fault-tolerant applications, and protect their applications from the failure of a single location.

### Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks to define the IP address range for Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and subnets within a VPC. CIDR notation is a standard syntax for representing IP address ranges and their associated subnet masks.

When creating a VPC, you specify the IP address range for the VPC in CIDR notation. For example, if you specify the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, it means that the VPC will have IP addresses ranging from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.255.255.

When creating a subnet within a VPC, you also specify the IP address range for the subnet in CIDR notation. For example, if you specify the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24, it means that the subnet will have IP addresses ranging from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.255.

The CIDR notation consists of an IP address and a prefix, separated by a forward slash. The prefix is a number that represents the number of bits in the subnet mask. The subnet mask is a binary value that is used to divide the IP address range into smaller subnets.

For example, if you use the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16, the first 16 bits of the IP addresses in that range are used for the network ID and the remaining bits are used for the host ID. This means that the network ID is 10.0.0.0 and the host ID can be any value from 0.0 to 255.255, resulting in a total of 65536 possible IP addresses in that range.

CIDR blocks also allows to use overlapping IP ranges. AWS automatically routes traffic between VPCs and subnets using the most specific CIDR block that matches the destination IP address.
