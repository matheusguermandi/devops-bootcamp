## Jenkins

---

Jenkins is an open-source automation tool that is primarily used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of software projects. One common use case for Jenkins is to automatically build and test software code changes that are committed to a version control system, such as Git. Jenkins also has a wide range of plugins available that allow you to integrate it with other tools and systems, such as JIRA, Slack, and AWS.

A "Free-style" pipeline in Jenkins is a flexible, general-purpose pipeline that can be used to automate a wide variety of tasks and processes. Here is an simple example:

```bash
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Update Repositories') {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://github.com/my-repository/my-app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build Image') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker build -t my-app .'
            }
        }
        stage('Unit Tests') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker run -it --rm my-app mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Push to Registry') {
            steps {
                sh 'docker tag my-app my-registry.com/my-app:latest'
                sh 'docker push my-registry.com/my-app:latest'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
            steps {
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml'
                sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}


```

This pipeline begins with the "pipeline" block, which defines the overall structure of the pipeline. The first stage of the pipeline is the "Update Repositories" stage. In this stage, Jenkins will check out the code from a Git repository.

The second stage is the "Build Image" stage. In this stage, Jenkins will use the Docker build command to create an image of the application.

The third stage is the "Unit Tests" stage. In this stage, Jenkins will run the automated tests for the application using the Maven testing framework.

The fourth stage is the "Push to Registry" stage. In this stage, Jenkins will use the Docker push command to push the image to a registry.

The final stage of the pipeline is the "Deploy to Kubernetes" stage. In this stage, Jenkins will use the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl) to deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

Please note that this pipeline is just an example, you need to change the git url, the registry url, and kubectl command based on your project. Also, you need to check if the kubectl command is configured on your jenkins server.
