# DevOps BootCamp - Notes

This is a repository to put some notes about my trajectory to learn more about DevOps. Each of these files has a well-defined topic, from the basic (for instance: base-linux-commands) to more specific subjects such as Kubernetes. One of the special motivations to build this repo is to have a place to search for already things learned.
