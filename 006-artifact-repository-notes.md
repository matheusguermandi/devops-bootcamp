## Artifact repository

---

An artifact repository is a centralized storage location for binary files, also known as artifacts, that are created during the build process of a software project. These artifacts can include compiled code, libraries, and other resources that are needed to run the software.

Artifact repositories are used to store and manage the various binary files that are produced during the software development process. These files can include compiled code, libraries, configuration files, and other resources that are needed to run the software. Having a centralized repository for these files makes it easy for developers to share and reuse them across different parts of an organization.

There are several types of artifact repositories, but the most common are:

- Binary Repository Manager: They are used to store and manage binary files, like libraries, modules, and executables.
- Package Repository Manager: They are used to store and manage packages, like deb, rpm, npm, etc.

One of the main benefits of using an artifact repository is that it allows for easy sharing of binary files across different parts of an organization. For example, developers can use the repository to store compiled code that can be easily accessed and used by other teams such as QA and Operations.

Artifact repositories also typically provide features such as search, access control, and reporting, making it easy to manage and organize your artifacts. They also provide versioning and metadata management, which makes it easy to track changes and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

Another benefit of using an artifact repository is that it can act as a proxy for remote repositories. This means that it can cache remote artifacts and serve them to clients. This can be useful for organizations that have limited internet access or want to control the access to external repositories.

Popular artifact repository managers include:

- Nexus: a widely-used, open-source artifact repository manager that can be used to store and manage binary files for a variety of different programming languages and build tools.
- JFrog Artifactory: a widely-used, commercial artifact repository manager that supports a wide range of formats, including Maven, NuGet, npm, and more.
- Apache Archiva: An open-source artifact repository manager that supports Maven and other formats.
- Sonatype CLM (Component Lifecycle Management): a commercial solution that integrates with Nexus and provide additional features like security, governance and compliance.

It's important to note that choosing the right artifact repository for your project depends on the specific needs of your project and the technology stack you are using. Some organizations may choose to use a single artifact repository to manage all of their artifacts, while others may choose to use multiple repositories to handle different types of artifacts.

In summary, artifact repositories are a centralized storage location for the binary files, also known as artifacts, that are created during the build process of a software project, it's important to use them to manage and share the artifacts, also to have a better control of them and make it easy to track changes and roll back to previous versions if necessary.
